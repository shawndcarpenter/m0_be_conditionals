I tried a few different options and checked the terminal for error messages and output. I eventually found a solution that made the code say what I wanted every time, which meant changing the chronology of the code so that it would check to see if the number was divisible by both 3 and 5 first, so that it would stop on that line. This was a very satisfying process, and I felt a sense of acheivement when it was done.
